# f1CarbonFree
How the f1 calendar should look like in order to minimize the CO2 impact on the world.

I took inspiration from the video of "Off The Grid" on YouTube on how to generate a better calendar for F1 to have less CO2 emission during travelling from a circuit to another. 
I used a dictionary instead of a list to organize every race, to get access not only to the coordinates but also to the name of the circuit, with the intention to be easier to read while excecuting.
